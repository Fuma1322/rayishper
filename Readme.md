## Introduction

Rayishper started as a simple note-taking practice to assist with various cybersecurity tasks. It has now evolved into an automated toolkit that can perform a wide range of pentesting activities such as password cracking, network sniffing, social engineering, and more.

## Features

- **Password Cracking:** Automate brute-force attacks using tools like John the Ripper and aircrack-ng.
- **Network Attacks:** Perform ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, port scanning, and packet sniffing.
- **Payload Generation:** Create custom payloads for Android devices using Metasploit.
- **Social Engineering:** Launch social engineering attacks using the SET toolkit.
- **File and Directory Management:** Automate common file and directory operations like viewing, deleting, and scanning.
- **Script Automation:** Convert repetitive manual tasks into automated scripts.

## Installation

Clone the Rayishper repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/rayishper.git
cd rayishper

## Make the script executable:
chmod +x rayishper.py
